				<h2>About ICUE 2015</h2>
				<p>
				The International Conference for Upcoming Engineers (ICUE) was initiated by members of Ryerson University in 2001 to explore different options after graduation and to network with successful professionals in various engineering fields. Over the years, the conference has explored various hot topics of engineering including Design, Entrepreneurship, etc. <br/><br/>Having held ICUE three times - 2013, 2010 and 2008, IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch is honoured to present you ICUE 2015.  ICUE2015 will feature keynote addressing engineering entrepreneurship, discussion panels on selected 4th year projects and on the valuable experiences of industry professionals from successful startup companies, along with workshops on skills needed to launch a startup company. We are also bringing together top design projects from engineering universities across Southern Ontario, top projects will be receiving cash prizes as well.			
				</p><br/><br/>
				<p>
				As the ICUE 2015 organizer, we're looking forward to seeing you. Spaces are limited, so <a href="#sp9" class="tlink navlink">Register Now!</a></p>

		<br/><p>The Institute of IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch is pleased to invite teams to compete in the annual International Conference for Upcoming Engineers (ICUE) design fair, in which the top design teams will be receiving cash prizes.</p>

			<p>
			The design fair is an important part of the annual International Conference for Upcoming Engineers (ICUE), which will be hosted by the University of Toronto this year on Saturday, May 9, 2015, with the theme The Next Step in Engineering Innovation. Teams are encouraged to participate with design projects from all areas of electrical, electronics, and computer engineering. The projects will be judged by professionals based on a specific set of criteria and the top three project will receive a cash prize.
			<br></br>
			In addition to the design fair, select design projects will also be given the opportunity to receive critique and advice on its potential and entrepreneurial possibilities by our panel of expert judges and professionals, helping design teams to potentially take their project one step further.			
			<br></br>
			If you and your team have a great project you wish to showcase, this is an excellent opportunity to share your work, win great prizes, connect with industry leaders, and participate in the rest of the conference which includes distinguished talks, panels, workshops, and an evening banquet.
